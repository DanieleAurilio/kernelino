# kernelino
Kernelino is a lightweight, in terminal, OS, written in Rust, featuring a Virtual File System (VFS) for flexible file management, a Virtual Process Management (VPM) system for process control, and a Virtual Memory Management (VMM) system for efficient memory handling.
All is handled in Ram memory.

It is still under development, currently developing a minimal lua parser, to enable people to run lua code.

The KPM seems to be very powerful but also very complicated to implement, maybe it is not the time.
