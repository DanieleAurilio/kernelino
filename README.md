# kernelino
Kernelino is a lightweight, terminal-based OS written in Rust, featuring a Virtual File System (VFS) for flexible file management, a Virtual Process Management (VPM) system for process control, and a Virtual Memory Management (VMM) system for efficient memory handling.

It is still under development, try to refactor code and implement a new way to handle vfs (i do not appreciate the current implementation).
The KPM seems to be very powerful but also very complicated to implement, maybe it is not the time.
